This assignment consists of two parts:

1. setting up new tables
2. completing drills using knex.

Firstly, add a SQL file called create.shopping-list.sql 
in the knex-practice project's ./sql-scripts folder. 
This file should contain the SQL to create a new 
TYPE called grocery and a new TABLE called shopping_list. 
The table will contain 6 columns and you will need to 
decide which SQL data types to use for each column. 
We'll supply you with a second SQL file that you will 
use to seed the shopping_list table items.

Note: You may see a warning in VSCode to install a missing 
extension for mssql whenever you open a SQL file. 
You can safely ignore this warning.

The grocery TYPE should be an ENUM that can be one of the 
following possible values:

Main
Snack
Lunch
Breakfast
The shopping_list table should have the following 6 columns. 
None of the columns should allow null values.

A primary key column id
A name column
A price column that should not be a string and support 2 decimal places.
A date_added column that should default to now().
A checked column that should be a BOOLEAN with a default of false.
A category column. Use the grocery type you created for this column.
